**By Johnny Ray Alt**

## Description
**A react clone of an angular project**


### Notes & Thoughts

#### Friday June, 29th

###### NOTES

> 1pm : look up dynamic routing

> Week 2 3:30pm: 2 hours researching redirecting routes after submitting form - no luck

###### THOUGHTS

> Angular vs React: I'm finding that for smaller applications React has major benefits over Angular in terms of learning curve, and the time it takes to get a skeleton up and running is significantly less in React. I find that the rigidity of Angular can be far more difficult to work with than the sparseness of React.
